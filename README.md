**Unity 5 2D Platformer Game Demo**
*by Eric "ongosub" Holsinger*

The page with information about this project and the tutorial is at
http://www.ongosub.com/p/unity-5-2d-platform-game-tutorial-mac.html

I will be building a 2D Platformer in Unity 5 and I'll be showing how to do the steps in both Unity scripting languages (both C# and UnityScript/JavaScript). So, regardless of which language you choose, this tutorial will help you in either one. 

The content online includes links to YouTube videos explaining each step.

Got a question, or comment, send me a note.
